## Developer resources

In general VeChainThor is mostly compatible to the Ethereum blockchain. It currently uses the same Ethereum Virtual Machine and the same smart contract development language - Solidity.
Due to the improvements which benefit users and enterprises, libraries or SDKs are required for development compatibility with existing tools like Truffle or Remix.
